This is a very simple HTML project where I implemented HTML, CSS, Node.js, and JavaScript to create a basic login and sign-up system. The front-end consists of clean HTML pages styled with CSS, including signup.html, login.html, and success.html.
On the backend, I used Node.js with the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests and interact with a MySQL database, where user credentials (username, email, and password) are stored.
The sign-up page allows users to create an account, which is saved in the database. After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page.
Upon logging in with valid credentials, they are taken to a simple success page.

To run the project, Node.js needs to be installed.
I downloaded Node.js from https://nodejs.org and installed the LTS version. During the setup, I made sure to select the option to add Node to the systemâ€™s PATH.
